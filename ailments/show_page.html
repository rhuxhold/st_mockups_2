				<h5>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h5>
        <p>
					Pain is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli, such as stubbing a toe, burning a finger, putting alcohol on a cut, and bumping the "funny bone".[1] Because it is a complex, subjective phenomenon, defining pain has been a challenge. The International Association for the Study of Pain's widely used definition states: "Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage."[2]
        </p>
        <p>
					Pain motivates the individual to withdraw from damaging situations, to protect a damaged body part while it heals, and to avoid similar experiences in the future.[3] Most pain resolves promptly once the painful stimulus is removed and the body has healed, but it may persist despite removal of the stimulus and apparent healing of the body. Sometimes pain arises in the absence of any detectable stimulus, damage or disease.[4]
        </p>
        <p>
					Pain is the most common reason for physician consultation in most developed countries.[5][6] It is a major symptom in many medical conditions, and can significantly interfere with a person's quality of life and general functioning.[7] Psychological factors such as social support, hypnotic suggestion, excitement, or distraction can significantly modulate pain's intensity or unpleasantness.[8][9] In some arguments put forth in physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia debates, pain has been used as an argument to permit terminally ill patients to end their lives.[10]

            How Effective is Cannabis in Treating the Ailment: Pain
          </h3>
          <p>
          Cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are the main cannabinoids present in marijuana. When consumed, they have a synergistic effect, which is to lower inflammation, manage spasms, and put off neurological pain.

          <h3>
            Why is Cannabis Helpful in Treating the Ailment: Pain
          </h3>
          <p>
           Our bodies already produce cannabinoids which are also present in marijuana. Cannabinoids influence various body processes such as pain and inflammation. Therefore, if someone consumes marijuana, it can assist those natural chemicals to function more efficiently. Specifically, cannabinoids can relieve pain symptoms.
